      <p>
        Apart from being a web developer, I enjoy most of my time being outdoors. In the winter, I am an avid skiier and novice ice climber.
        During the warmer months here in Toronto, I enjoy mountain biking, free climbing, and kayaking. When forced indoors, I follow a number of sci-fi and fantasy genre movies and television shows, I am an aspiring chef,
        and I spend a large amount of my free time exploring the latest technolgy advancements in the front-end web development world.
